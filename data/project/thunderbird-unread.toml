Description = "After using [Neomutt](https://www.neomutt.org/) together with [Notmuch](https://notmuchmail.org/) for quite a while, I switched back to [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/) for higher reliability. However, Thunderbird is not really scriptable, so I had to come up with a way to at least show me very basic status information for my email accounts."
